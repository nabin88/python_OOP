    "# Encapsulation in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, encapsulation is a fundamental concept of object-oriented programming (OOP) that involves bundling data and methods together within a class. It allows the class to control access to its own members, ensuring that they are used and modified appropriately. It helps in maintaining the integrity and consistency of an object's state by providing controlled access to\n",

    "## Is a student ready for graduation?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a simple example of a script written using the object oriented programming in Python. We can use it to check the details of a student, for example, age, ethnicity, enrollment year, credit hours, number of publications. If a professor in a university has a big group of students working for him, programs like this can be useful to keep track of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we have a Students class that represents a student object. The attributes ethnicity and year_enrolled are encapsulated within the class. To access these attributes from outside the class, we use getter and setter methods. The getter methods (get_Ethnicity() and get_YearEnrolled() allow us to retrieve the values of the attributes, while the setter methods (set_Ethnicity() and set_YearEnrolled() allow us to modify the values of the attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this particular example, a student will meet the requirements for graduation if he completes 120 credit hours and publish at least one paper."
